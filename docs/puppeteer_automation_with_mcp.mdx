The Puppeteer MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides powerful web automation capabilities through a standardized interface. This guide covers the available tools, screenshot functionality, and best practices for interacting with web pages.

## Available Tools

The Puppeteer MCP server exposes the following tools:

1. **puppeteer_navigate** - Navigate to a URL
2. **puppeteer_screenshot** - Take a screenshot of the current page or a specific element
3. **puppeteer_click** - Click an element on the page
4. **puppeteer_fill** - Fill out an input field
5. **puppeteer_select** - Select an option from a dropdown menu
6. **puppeteer_hover** - Hover over an element on the page
7. **puppeteer_evaluate** - Execute JavaScript in the browser console

### Tool Usage Examples

#### Navigate to a URL
```json
{
  "name": "puppeteer_navigate",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```

#### Take a Screenshot
```json
{
  "name": "puppeteer_screenshot",
  "arguments": {
    "name": "example-screenshot",
    "selector": "#main-content",
    "width": 1024,
    "height": 768
  }
}
```

#### Click an Element
```json
{
  "name": "puppeteer_click",
  "arguments": {
    "selector": "#submit-button"
  }
}
```

#### Fill an Input Field
```json
{
  "name": "puppeteer_fill",
  "arguments": {
    "selector": "#search-input",
    "value": "Puppeteer automation"
  }
}
```

## Screenshot Capabilities

The `puppeteer_screenshot` tool offers flexible screenshot options:

- Capture the entire page or a specific element using CSS selectors
- Customize screenshot dimensions
- Screenshots are stored with unique names for easy reference
- Access screenshots through the `screenshot://` resource URI

## Best Practices for Web Page Interaction

1. **Wait for Elements**: Use appropriate selectors and ensure elements are present before interacting with them.

2. **Handle Dynamic Content**: For pages with dynamic content, consider using the `puppeteer_evaluate` tool to wait for specific conditions.

3. **Error Handling**: Always check the `isError` flag in tool responses to handle potential failures gracefully.

4. **Console Logging**: Utilize the `puppeteer_evaluate` tool to execute custom JavaScript and capture console output for debugging.

5. **Resource Management**: Access browser console logs through the `console://logs` resource for additional insights.

6. **Viewport Management**: Set appropriate viewport sizes when taking screenshots to ensure consistent results.

7. **Sequential Operations**: Chain operations in a logical sequence, e.g., navigate, wait for element, interact, then capture screenshot.

## Example Workflow

Here's a sample workflow demonstrating the use of multiple tools:

1. Navigate to a website
2. Fill out a search form
3. Click the search button
4. Take a screenshot of the results

```json
[
  {
    "name": "puppeteer_navigate",
    "arguments": { "url": "https://example.com" }
  },
  {
    "name": "puppeteer_fill",
    "arguments": { "selector": "#search-input", "value": "Puppeteer MCP" }
  },
  {
    "name": "puppeteer_click",
    "arguments": { "selector": "#search-button" }
  },
  {
    "name": "puppeteer_screenshot",
    "arguments": { "name": "search-results", "selector": "#results-container" }
  }
]
```

By leveraging these tools and following best practices, you can create powerful web automation workflows using the Puppeteer MCP server.
