This guide covers common issues you may encounter when using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, along with steps to resolve them.

## Connection Problems

### Server Not Starting

**Error:** The MCP server fails to start or crashes immediately.

**Possible Causes:**
- Missing dependencies
- Incorrect configuration
- Port conflicts

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Ensure all required dependencies are installed.
2. Check the server logs for specific error messages.
3. Verify the configuration file is correctly formatted.
4. Try running the server on a different port.

### Client Can't Connect to Server

**Error:** The client is unable to establish a connection with the MCP server.

**Possible Causes:** 
- Server not running
- Incorrect server address/port
- Firewall blocking connection

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Confirm the server is running and listening for connections.
2. Double-check the server address and port in the client configuration.
3. Temporarily disable firewalls to test if that's the issue.
4. Ensure the server and client are on the same network or the server is publicly accessible.

## Authentication Errors

### Invalid API Key

**Error:** "Authentication Failed: Invalid API key"

**Resolution:**
1. Verify you are using the correct API key.
2. Check if the API key has expired or been revoked.
3. Regenerate a new API key if necessary.

### Permission Denied

**Error:** "Permission Denied: Insufficient privileges"

**Resolution:**
1. Review the permissions associated with your API key or user account.
2. Request additional permissions if needed.
3. Ensure you're not trying to access resources outside your allowed scope.

## Rate Limiting Issues

### Rate Limit Exceeded

**Error:** "Rate Limit Exceeded: Too many requests"

**Resolution:**
1. Implement backoff and retry logic in your client code.
2. Review your usage patterns and optimize to reduce the number of requests.
3. Consider upgrading your account or requesting a higher rate limit.

## Resource-Specific Problems

### Resource Not Found

**Error:** "Resource not found: [resource URI]"

**Resolution:**
1. Double-check the resource URI for typos.
2. Verify the resource exists on the server.
3. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the resource.

### Invalid Resource Format

**Error:** "Invalid resource format: Unable to parse"

**Resolution:**
1. Review the format of the resource you're trying to access or modify.
2. Ensure it conforms to the expected schema or data structure.
3. Validate your input data before sending it to the server.

## Tool Execution Errors

### Unknown Tool

**Error:** "Unknown tool: [tool name]"

**Resolution:**
1. Check the tool name for typos.
2. Use the `list_tools` endpoint to get a list of available tools.
3. Ensure you're using a tool that's supported by the specific MCP server.

### Invalid Tool Arguments

**Error:** "Invalid arguments for [tool name]"

**Resolution:**
1. Review the tool's input schema to ensure you're providing all required arguments.
2. Check argument types and formats (e.g., date formats, number ranges).
3. Use schema validation in your client code to catch errors before sending requests.

## Database-Specific Issues

### SQL Query Errors

**Error:** "Database error: [SQL error message]"

**Resolution:**
1. Review your SQL query syntax.
2. Ensure table and column names are correct.
3. Check for proper quoting of string values.
4. Verify you have the necessary permissions to execute the query.

### Table Creation Failures

**Error:** "Error creating table: [error details]"

**Resolution:**
1. Ensure the table doesn't already exist.
2. Check if you have the necessary permissions to create tables.
3. Review the table schema for any invalid column definitions.

## General Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Check Server Logs:** Always review the server logs for detailed error messages and stack traces.

2. **Update to Latest Version:** Ensure you're using the latest version of both the MCP server and client libraries.

3. **Verify Configuration:** Double-check all configuration files for syntax errors or incorrect settings.

4. **Test with Minimal Example:** Create a minimal test case that reproduces the issue to isolate the problem.

5. **Network Diagnostics:** Use tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, or `netstat` to diagnose network-related issues.

6. **Consult Documentation:** Refer to the specific MCP server's documentation for any unique troubleshooting steps.

7. **Community Support:** Check community forums or issue trackers for similar problems and solutions.

If you continue to experience issues after trying these troubleshooting steps, consider reaching out to the MCP server's support team or community for further assistance.
